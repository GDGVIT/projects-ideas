The [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.torproject.org),
a project under The Tor Project that aims to uncover internet censorship by
monitoring its prevalence around the world, is seeking a UX designer to improve
the UI of its desktop (web based) and mobile client.

We are looking for someone that can:

1. Review the overall UX flow and provide suggestions for improvements to
   the application flow.

2. Provide suggestions for improvements to the layout of the mobile and desktop
   client.

3. Construct design assets and make the visual style of the desktop and mobile
   client more coherent.

You can find screenshots of the current views for the current desktop client
here: [https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-wui/issues/4#issuecomment-252314702](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-wui/issues/4#issuecomment-252314702)

You can find screenshots of the current views for the mobile client here:
[https://github.com/measurement-kit/netprobe-ios/issues/43](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-wui/issues/4#issuecomment-252314702)

We are a dynamic team that works from different places around the world. Most of
our coordination happens via the internet, on public issue trackers (github)
and more real time coordination happens via IRC (irc.oftc.net #ooni). Ideally
you would be comfortable working with these tools.

Many of us are based out of Italy (mainly Rome), so we would prefer somebody that
is located closest, but this is not a strict requirement.

If this project interests you, please reach out to us and we can discuss it in
more detail. We know that other projects related to OONI are hoping to hire
designers in the near term, so we would love it if this [could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= 5kiNJcDG4E0).

When applying for this position please include:

1. A link to your portfolio containing relevant work

2. Your Curriculum Vitae
