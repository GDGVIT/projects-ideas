Our app uses machine learning to make predictive models of traffic in the streets.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are also usually applied to traffic prediction problems because of its advantages, such as their capability to work with multi-dimensional data, implementation,flexibility and strong forecasting power.
Our app shows the user where the traffic is predicted to be excess at particular timings. 
This makes his day-to-day life easy. He can use the app to navigate through the streets to see which street has more traffic and hence use other routes to reach the destination in shorter time.
