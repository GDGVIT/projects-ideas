The aim of our project is to make life a little easier for the visually challenged people. Consider a non-profit organisation which works for the welfare of visually challenged people. It would be difficult for the occupants to do the day-to-day activities that normal people can do quite easily. The easiest way for them to communicate is through speech. We aim to create a speech recognition software to help them in tasks around their home. The speech recognition software can be built with the help of neural networks and machine learning. We want to link the basic electrical appliances in the home to the software so that they can turn on/off them by just speaking into a smartphone which has an app linked to the electrical appliances using IoT. Additionally, the app can also be used to change the settings of the appliance such as increasing the TV volume, etc. as per their convenience.
