The Tor Project is seeking to create a visual and typographic style guide to harmonize and professionalize the presentation of its various efforts.

Tor has historically used a variety of purples (primary color) and greens (secondary color). What should be the canonical shades? What palette should be used in conjunction with the principal colors?

This job is to produce a style guide describing use the existing wordmark, colors, and onion logo.  Re-designing the existing logo is out of scope.

The style guide should cover font choice and logo use (placement, spacing, and alignment) for digital & print. Printed matter include slide templates, letterhead, and other assets.

Simply Secure is acting as project manager, email ux@simplysecure.org to express interest. To read the creative brief for this project see [Creative Brief for Tor Project Style Guide](https://github.com/simplysecure/tor/blob/master/CreativeBriefforTorProjectStyleGuide.pdf)
