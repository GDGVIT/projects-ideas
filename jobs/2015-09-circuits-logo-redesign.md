Hi, Currently our logo is less than ideal and cannot be used easily with
things like Gravatars, Github profiles or even fit nicely with our website.

See: https://github.com/circuits/circuits/blob/master/docs/logo.png

The overall design/theme was around the notion of Python (*the programming language*)
and software as flexible as circuits (*no pun intended!*) where various pieces of your
software system are made up of and composed of smaller components.

We're en open source project with no funding; so any help would be greatly appreciated!

cheers
