Hey. =^.^=

[Value Flows](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows) is an open source project to help a lot of alternative economic software projects that are solving different pieces of the same puzzle be able to work together.

We're interested in collaborating with open source designers who share [our vision](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/blob/master/PRINCIPLES.md), who can help us to more effectively communicate our vision through visual design.

As a first step, we [started a thread for communicating Value Flows through visual design](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/38). If you're interested, join in the conversation there, participate in our [other conversations](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues), or message @ahdinosaur directly. :)
