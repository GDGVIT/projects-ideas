The FreeCAD project does not care enough about design. For example, the section about UX on our forum contain 600 posts compare to the 25 000 posts of the developer corner. A simple look at the aspect of the forum or the web site will convince you we need more designer in charge.
So we need to change, but we don't know how. The mission of the job is to proposed solutions to improve the current situation. This could be achieved by posting a list of action to perform, an image, a philosophy to preach, a formation to proposed, an article to read, I do not know. We just need help.
The idea of this job offer come after watching the great bunch of presentations made by the OpenSourceDesign community at the Fosdem 2017. You are awesome.
