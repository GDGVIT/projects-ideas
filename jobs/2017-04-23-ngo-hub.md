There are many sites like eventshigh.com that notify you regarding all the events especially parties and all coming up near you. On the same lines, why not an entire website or app that brings together all the NGOs around you under one roof. NGO events, NGO volunteering work, help that the NGOs can extend (therapy sessions for domestic violence victims) and much more. 
We could have NGOs of all spheres : Women issues , Education, Child Labour, Handicap. The user can connect and volunteer directly with the NGO. All the hassles of fetching for an NGO working for our cause is solved.
