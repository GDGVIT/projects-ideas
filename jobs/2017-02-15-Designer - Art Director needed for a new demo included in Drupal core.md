## What are we looking for?
A person willing to contribute work as a designer and art director for a new demo website being created for inclusion in Drupal core. Having prior experience with any open source project is certainly a bonus, but is not a necessary requirement. You will be working alongside a team of experienced Drupal contributors who will help you get started working with an open source community.

## Project overview
We plan to create a demo website (in the form of an installation profile) of Drupal. Users will be able to try this out when installing Drupal. The main purpose of this demo is to convince technical evaluators that Drupal allows them to build modern and beautiful websites, from conceptions into real life use cases. The demo use case will be a food publishing website. We plan to leave all Drupal-related terminology out of the demo. This is to make sure that there is a separation between the branding of Drupal and demonstrating Drupal. There is no pre-existing designs to leverage. We plan to give the designer carte blanche.

## Process
The lead designer will work closely with the team working on the demo to create a proposal for the Drupal community. Our community will be allowed to give feedback on the designs at certain defined stages of the project, however decisions and feedback about the designs will be handled at the teamâ€™s own discretion.

The design lead is expected to actively participate in our public weekly meetings.

## Timeline
The team is expecting to get started with the project as soon as possible after the application period. The team lead is expected to commit to the process throughout. The majority of time needed from the designer will be in the early stages of the project. During this stage you will be expected to work as a visual designer creating the initial design. After the initial design has been approved, the designer will transition into an art director role where they will be responsible for monitoring the quality of the implementation of the design.

The MVP version of the demo is planned to be added to Drupal 8.4, which means that the last day for getting the theme committed is July 29th 2017.

## Budget
There is no budget to pay people for working on this initiative. However, it is allowed for everyone working on it to have support from the organizations they work for, or any other organization that would like to fund their work.
