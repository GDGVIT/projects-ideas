Hi!

My name is Rory and I founded two open-source projects.
[FarmBot](http://farmbot.io) is an open-source CNC farming machine and web app designed for small scale automated DIY precision farming.
[OpenFarm](http://openfarm.cc) is a free and open database for farming and gardening knowledge.

We're starting to build a drag and drop farm designer/manager tool where one can graphically layout and keep track of plants on a map.
Think: Farmville, but with utility!
A core visual component of this will be crop icons that visually represent the plants.
We want these icons to be usable across different projects, scalable, and beautiful.
We have one contributor (@andru) who wants to contribute, and we would love more designers to help us out.
We would host the icons on OpenFarm and they would all be licensed very permissively (CC0/MIT) and be avilable for download and via the OpenFarm API.

We're having discussion about this here: https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/issues/685.
Please join in!
