1. Suppose a woman is getting verbally harassed by her in laws or by her husband. Even if she goes to the police, they will want proof. For the proof, what can happen is, she can wear a short pendant around her neck with a sound recorder. Double tapping on the middle of the pendant, a voice recorder gets activated which can record the voices and stream it to Drive, via Bluetooth. 

2. A taser like ring on a woman can be quite lethal if she is being harassed by somebody.

3. Problem: Harassment at workplace.
An application should be developed in which the victim can post her situation anonymously. The victim should somehow gather the proof and post it in the app. The name of the accused can also be posted with the location.
Women in our country are scared to post their name as they think the society does not accept them and the other problem is if she reveals her name she would be declared as a whistle blower outside and her statement can be manipulated by the higher authorities to save the name of the company.
