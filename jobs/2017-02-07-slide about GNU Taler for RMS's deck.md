title: slide about GNU Taler for RMS's deck
rate: gratis
description: "GNU Taler (https://taler.net/) is a new electronic payment system, and RMS would like to have 1-3 slides to show while he is talking about it when giving talks.\r\n\r\nWe have some ideas of what to show/draw, but creative ideas are welcome as well. The key point is to show that the person paying is anonymous, while the person receiving the money is transparent to the government."
skills: "The slides need to be in the style of the existing deck:\r\nhttps://static.fsf.org/nosvn/RMS_updated_FS_TEDx_slideshow.odp"
how_to_apply:
  - 'Just ping grothoff@taler.net for now.  '
  - "https://git.taler.net/ has slide decks in _incompatible_ styles (for RMS) in the 'marketing.git' repository. \r\n$ git clone git://taler.net/marketing\r\n\r\nNote that you will need pdflatex to generate PDFs..."
