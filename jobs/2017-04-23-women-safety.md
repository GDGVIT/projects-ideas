Now a days women's cannot go outside at night for that ,we have one plan that if she gets trapped by some strangers and others .And my idea about this project is like if she presses only three numbers from her mobile ,it sends a message to the nearby  police station and to her parents ..
And now im going to execute this idea by HTML coding and creating a website,through this when if someone in stranger only the thing is to type only the three digit no
