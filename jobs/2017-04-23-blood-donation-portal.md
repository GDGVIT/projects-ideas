It becomes very difficult for people to blood donar when they need it, so if there is a portal which connects the needy directly to people who are interested in donating elemenating the role of blood bank then the work will be fast and there will be more chances of getting the required group blood. And even blood banks don't have the required group most of the times so people have to suffer a lot because they have to completely depend on the blood bank. Hence such a portal will be a great help and will be something which is of great use.
