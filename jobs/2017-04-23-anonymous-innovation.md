This project basically covers the 10th track with a little twist. The major problem with farmers and technology in India is the gap that gets formed between. So this idea is to fill in the gap. This project won't be completely automatic. Basically there will be a script that will scrap new things related to farming and the problems (weather problems) in a particular area specifically. Mostly what happens is that farmers aren't aware of weather conditions and they don't come to know the calamities as early as they should be which ends up spoiling the crops. 
So this app will scrap the weather data from the web and then text message the farmers ( because they are not connected to the web or that facility is not available.) in there own language ( Google translator) and notify them of any calamity as in heavy rain that is predicted otherwise but they aren't aware of. I can explain you more properly if you allow. You might Say that how can all the farmers be connected to it or how do we have there numbers, this can be done through the government database (aadhar for example)  or manual registrations.
