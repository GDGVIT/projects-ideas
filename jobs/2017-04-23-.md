Track number 10. 
A basic application that will help the farmers know about the occurring weather calamity so that they are better prepared. The lag and gap between farmer and technology does not allow them to be updated at various aspect. Weather is one amongst many and the loss they suffer because of this is major. So basically this app will scrap the weather details of different areas and if there is a calamity to happen in near future, let's say, heavy rain. it will text message the farmers who ( don't have smart phone or net connection to know otherwise) are there in that area in there own language. This will enable them to be better prepared. And may avoid a major loss that they suffer.
There would also be a helpline number mentioned which will help them go about any other problem they face. This project can also be extended to help them get notified about various profitable crops for a area. Or maybe notify them of various government aids that is planned for them and never reaches them because they don't know about it.
