## PROJECT IN BRIEF

Phanbook is the next-generation Q&A and forum software that makes online discussion, question and answer site for professional and enthusiast people. Also the name Phanbook is mean - Phan(Phalcon PHP)book(the your note book)

## AESTHETICS:

Should fit with the general open source aestheticâ€”friendly, fun, playful, colorful. Should be something that a developer would want to wear on a t-shirt.

Given the prevalence of animal (hadoop, python, mysql, hive, SUSE, Mozilla, go, firefox, linux, PERL) and abstract human (drupal, basho, red hat) logos in Open Source, this may be an area to explore.

The goal for open source Phanbook is to appeal to developers, devops, bloger and content writer types.
