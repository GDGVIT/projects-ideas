This is a house alarm system which informs you when unknown people enter your house without your knowledge or in your absence. Ultrasonic sensor placed behind the doors is used to calculate the distance.  Once the distance reduces below the threshold value, the buzzer buzzes and informs the concerned people about the intruder. It can be switched on and off whenever required. Using Internet of Things an email can be sent to the concerned people when such a situation arises in case nobody is at home. A raspberry pi is used to connect to the cloud. This device will ensure that quick action is taken when any unpleasant situation arises.
