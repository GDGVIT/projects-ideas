`git-secret` is a bash-tool to store your private data inside a `git` repository.

We are currently promoting this app quite rapidly, so we need a simple, but stylish logo to be easily recognized.
You can check out these resources:

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11662364)
- [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/git-secret)
- [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/e-azzg/store-your-private-data-inside-a-git-repository)

What can we offer as the our part of the deal? You will be leased with `special-thanks` on both the website on the repository's main page.

If you woud like to participate, just send us a PR with the logo on the `github`, or email [sobolevn](https://github.com/sobolevn) directly!
