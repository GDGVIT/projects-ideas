In order to increase easier access to hospitals and make it more patient friendly , we wish to introduce a website that brings information about all the hospitals in your city.
1) As soon as the user opens the website ,first he\shw will be asked to sign up/log in accordingly.
2)The website will first ask for the city and then a dropdown box will appear containing hospitals  in that city- select the selection box against the city.
3)There will be options on the side which will include options like-appointments, availability, Ambulance, pathological labs, blood donation, medical history.
4) this website will serve as a medium between the patient and the hospital and will help the patient at each step.
5) if the user selects the appointment option- a drop down box will appear  containing the type of doctor required-physician, dermetologist, etc; after the user selects the type of doctor a text box will appear to take the appointment date. after this the website will search for the time of availbility of the doctor. if the user confirms the the time it will proceed for online payement.
6)  if the user selects availibility, then a drop down occurs for the name of hospital after this dropdown for the type of room wanted- text box for date, text box for reason and each user will be having an id and then it will be verified for security purpose
7)for emergency ambulance on double tapping a button the location will be tracked and then ambulance from the nearest hospital will reach the spot.
