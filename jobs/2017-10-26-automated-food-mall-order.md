I stay in L block in VIT which houses the food mall. As all vitians must be aware of, it is easily on of the most crowded areas. As a result students who are enrolled there wait there for almost 15-20mins for their food and additionally in the line. My project is based on removing the red tape and efficiently stream line the process for the benefit of students.
