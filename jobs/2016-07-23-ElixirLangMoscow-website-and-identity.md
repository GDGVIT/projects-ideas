We are launching first [`Elixir`](http://elixir-lang.org/) meetups in Russia.
And we really need help in desinging and branding.

It is non-comercial project.

## When?

We are planing to host the first event in the end of september. And to promote it since the 24th of august. So it is the deadline.

## What do we need?

We need the identity: logo, colors. We also need the website desing. And some email templates design as well.
There's also a strict rule about technology: since we are working with the 'top-edge' technology on the backend, the frontend should also be cool.
So we don't want to use Bootstrap or Foundation.

So this is a chance to try something new you always wanted but never had time to.

There's a cool thing we really like: http://hackcss.com/
It is not required, but maybe it would be an inspiration for someone.

## What can we offer?

Life-long gratis: your company's logo on the supporters page and/or link in the footer.
We can also offer any kind of promotion from our side.

We can also offer our help in writing and promoting articles about working with `Elixir`/`Phoenix` stack.
We can also invite you to speak at the meetup (if you are from Moscow).

## What tech you will need to get started?

Well, a lot of them. You can find the full list in our [`README`](https://github.com/elixir-lang-moscow/site#requirements).
Or you can just have [`Docker`](https://github.com/elixir-lang-moscow/site#docker).
