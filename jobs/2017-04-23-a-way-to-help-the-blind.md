A WAY TO HELP THE BLIND
One billion people, or 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability, and disability prevalence is higher for developing countries. Out of which 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide.
So in order to help these people we thought of an idea to help them out and make their lives easier.
Therefore we thought of a prototype – A Stick for the blind equipped with various sensors and it is connected to a smartphone which has an app installed with a braille pad and a doodle pen. The app will contain various features which are synchronised with the stick. The app will feature speech recognition as a major facility. It can be opened very conveniently by the click of the side buttons on the phone.
The average height of females is 5’3’’ and males is 5’6’’.So accordingly the height of the stick for women can be around  46’’ and for men around 50’’.
We can have 2 ultrasonic sensors one attached at the bottom of the stick and the other half way the length. It will detect the obstacles around and being connected to the phone will give voice message to the blind person using stick.We will also put Vibering sensor which helps them to notice vehicle’s or someone’s call at the back which often results in an unforeseen emergency. 

In case the blind person has to reach a specific location he or she can open the app and tell the location .The speech recogniser will enable and the stick will guide the person the way in order to reach the destination. This can be synchronised with google maps to enroute the shortest way possible. Also if the person has to travel by a bus or train(any other transport)the app will be updated with all the latest schedule of train and bus timings.
The app will obviously allow the person to have access the basic features of the phone through speech recognition like-
1.	Listen to music
2.	Send receive calls and messages-If there is a missed call, then there will be a regular 10 minutes’ reminder for the user.
3.	Weather status could be determined
4.	Time announcement
5.	Setting of alarms and important reminders
The app will also feature which would enable the bind person to recognize the thing in a way that the person need to click the picture of the object and with the help of net it would be recognized and told via a voice message.
The main feature of this app could be that the user could learn braille (the blind language) through a braille pad and a doodle pen.So the pen would be controlled by the phone wherein the braille pad slides down and the pen would come into use.

FEASIBILITY AND SUSTAINIBILITY
The creation of such a phone and a stick will be difficult initially but once created it would be of great help for the blind.
This phone is very sustainable and reliable for the blind.This device would have a huge impact on the society and would help overcome the bridge between the normal and visually impaired people. They would not feel out of the pond.
BUDGET
Talking about the budget, It is a bit costly but a dutiful and trustworthy support for the blind and once used frequently the cost would reduce seeing the present scenario of the smartphones we use.
