The upcoming Dutch hacker camp SHA2017 is looking for a design and therefore we ask YOU to submit a proposal.

Standing in the tradition of GHC 1989, HEU 1993, HIP 1997, HAL2001, WTH2005, HAR2009 and OHM2013 we need an awesome design to give our camp/conference a style.

Our call for design is available at: https://sha2017.org/call-for-design with more details.
