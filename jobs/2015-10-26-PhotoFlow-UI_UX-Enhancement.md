PhotoFlow is a quite recent image editor project, still in its early phases of development.

The main peculiarity is that the editing is based on layers like in GIMP, but in a non-destructive manner. It also provides advanced RAW image processing.

The project could greatly benefit from a review/improvement of the graphical user interface and user experience in general.

The goal is to make the task of image editing as much intuitive as possible, without sacrificing the advanced features.

The project is presently developed entirely for free, so no budget can be allocated for the UI/UX enhancement task.
