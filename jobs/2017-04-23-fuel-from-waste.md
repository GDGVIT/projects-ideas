In rural areas organic briquettes can be used . These are made from corn cobs , groundnuts , rice husk and other general waste generally found , lik agricultural wastes. This organic material should be combined with sawdust to form burnable briquettes.this sawdust can be taken from sawmills where they are grown out .  Briquettes waste less energy than firewood and furnaces to retain heat for a longer period of time .
