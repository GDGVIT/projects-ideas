We can build an app in which any person who is a user of that app can get help when they are not physically or mentally well. He or She can click the picture of the injured part and write the description below that . The app will be linked to  doctors specialized in different fields and after analyzing the problem described in the description , the concerning doctors of that field will be notified . Various doctors can suggest the best ways and the patient can get the best advice . By the use of this application , we can reduce the exploitation of people in medical hospitals and prevent them from going through some useless tests and checkups.
