The idea involves development of an app for the visually impaired using artificial intelligence APIs . This app will work on smartphones. The app will be connected/interfaced with the camera of the phone which would help in capturing the image of the object present before him/her, which in turn will be processed and converted into an audio signal . This will help the person "SEE"  the world before him/her. 

For example: 1)  If the person wants to view the menu in a restaurant, he/she doesn't need to ask for help to read out the menu, instead he/she can take a picture of the menu via the app, and the app generates the audio version of the menu.


2) Suppose the person goes to a store and he wants to buy a Sunsilk shampoo of yellow variant but all he can figure out by touching is the  shape of the container and not the colour (variant )  so this app comes to his rescue . He can open the app which connects it to the camera , he can then move the phone over the shelf and the audio will give him a gist of the product like - brand,variant,price etc he can also scan the bar code of the product for more information.

3) They can use it for navigation purposes also.

Revenue model :  Revenue by allowing ads on our app and sponsors.
If the user wants an ad-free version, they will be charged a minimal fee for the same.
