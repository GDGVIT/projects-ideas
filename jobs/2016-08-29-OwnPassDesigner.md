OwnPass is a self hosted, open source password management tool.
It's an open source package of applications and browser extensions that make it possible to manage secure data across multiple devices.

## Why use a password manager?

[How To Geek wrote a very good article about this](http://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/), so instead of reinventing the wheel, let me quote them.

> The majority of people use very weak passwords and reuse them on different websites. How are you supposed to use > strong, unique passwords on all the websites you use? The solution is a password manager.
> Password managers store your login information for all the websites you use and help you log into them automatically.
> They encrypt your password database with a master password â€“ the master password is the only one you have to remember.

## How OwnPass is different from existing software?

We've described this in the [Unique Selling Points](https://github.com/ownpass/ownpass/wiki/Unique-Selling-Points) page and [competition page](https://github.com/ownpass/ownpass/wiki/Competition) of our wiki.

## What you will do?

You will create the visual appearance of the product.
This ranges from the logo to the layouts of the devices that we will support.
We plan to support the devices listed here: https://github.com/ownpass/ownpass/wiki/Features#devices the control panel where one can log in to browser extensions and the mobile apps.
