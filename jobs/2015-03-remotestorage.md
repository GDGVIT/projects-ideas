# UI Design for remoteStorage-connect widget/dialog

This is a freelance gig for improving the user interface and experience of a
general-purpose open-source library, used in many different apps.

[RemoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) in a nutshell: users can tell Web
apps to sync data where they want it, without the app developer ever hosting or
touching their data. Users can choose between Google Drive, Dropbox or
RemoteStorage. The latter is an open-source protocol that can be used by anyone
to create data storage/sync servers. App developers can use this library to
easily integrate support for data sync via these options into their apps.

You will be responsible for re-designing the connect/sync UI, which apps offer
by default when they use
[remoteStorage.js](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js).

The work is sponsored by 5apps, a commercial provider of remoteStorage
accounts.
