Every semester we are left with books which are no longer useful for us, but is definitely needed by juniors. So we can have a book sharing app to enable people to post the books that they don't need. Interested buyers can contact the person to buy the book. 
I have made a website: vitbookshare.in . We can improve on the idea, have a webapp, an android app and an IOS app.
