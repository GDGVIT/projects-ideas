We  can  create  an  application  like  alarm  for  blind  people  to  product  them   from  the  dangerous  place  when  they  are  walking  by  keeping  their  mobile  phone  with  them  or  making  the  alert  from  the  mobile  phones  to  instruct  them  and  guide  them  it is  useful  when they  are  out..without  help  of  others......for  deaf   using  phone  we  can  make   message  with  vibrate   to alert  them  when  they  are  crossing  the  road  to  instruct  them  or  any  one  call  them   etc..
