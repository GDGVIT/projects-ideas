[Silex](http://www.silex.me/) is a free and open source website builder (community driven), that can be used directly in a browser. It is an alternative to Wix, Squarespace, etc.

This job offer is a one time mission to make our free templates responsive / mobile friendly. It is also a way to involve a designer, teach him / her how to use the new functionnalities we developed, and maybe document it for others. **If you are interested, please contact us at `contact at silexlabs.org`**.

Indeed, we have just released [a new version on editor.silex.me](http://editor.silex.me), the instance hosted by [Silex Labs our non profit org.](https://www.silexlabs.org/). It includes a new mobile editor / responsive design mode, and a possibility to save your work on Github directly from Silex.

Here is [our repository of creative commons templates](http://templates.silex.me/). The templates need to be made responsive with the latest version of Silex. This can be done by opening each template in Silex from Github, folowing a short list of instructions, then saving the responsive version back on Github.
