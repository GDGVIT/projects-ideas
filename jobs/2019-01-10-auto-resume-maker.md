This project aims at making the web app (and might be mobile app too in future) that aids in making the resume of a person. The thing which is different here is that here one doesn't need to enter all the data (or you can say information) about themselves like their accomplishments, skills, languages they know ,etc instead they just need to enter the websites where they have already have good profile (like LinkedIn, HackerEarth, Hackerrank, CodeForces, Spoj etc). Then (after entering the credentials ) all the relevant data will be scrapped and then you can select a suitable layout and bingo you are done. That's it :). 
The Project use Python's library Selenium which will enable us to browse through a webpage and also let's us to click through the links.
