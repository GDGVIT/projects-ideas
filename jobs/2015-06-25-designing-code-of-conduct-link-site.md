Code of Conduct Link is a way of creating and monitoring a list of projects that have a Code of Conduct, and check for a series of diversity related facts on the project.

The project is getting there architecturally, but it would be great if a UI Designer could lend a couple of hours of time to help us figure out the brand and style of the website. It should be fairly straightforward.
