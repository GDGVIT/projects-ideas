Carbon (https://carbonads.net/) is an advertising platform aiming developers and designers. Materialize, Semantic and many technology related websites already use Carbon.

The ads I've personally seen and they will have just one ad on a page and that ad is totally relevant to the developer seeing the page. And the ads are totally customizable as well!

I don't know about the money we might make. But Ads from Carbon will be really helpful imo.
