[`awesome-cryptography`](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography) is a curated list of cryptography resources and links.

And we a have a twitter integration (out [account](https://twitter.com/awe_crypto_bot)). Our bot posts new pull-requests and commits to the repo on twitter feed.
So that's basically it. It will be much easier to promote an account with nice and smooth logo.

We can offer a author's name (account) mention in the account description.
