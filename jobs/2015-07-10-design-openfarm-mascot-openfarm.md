OpenFarm is a free and open database and web application for farming and gardening knowledge.
One might think of it as the Wikipedia or Freebase for growing plants, though it functions more like a cooking recipes site.
The main content are Growing Guides: creative, crowd-sourced, single-author, structured documents that include all of the necessary information for a person or machine to grow a plant, i.e.: seed spacing and depth, watering regimen, recommended soil composition and companion plants, sun/shade requirements, etc.

OpenFarm is looking for a mascot!
Have a look at [our issue](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/issues/639) concerning this, and how it might [work on the app](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/issues/638).
