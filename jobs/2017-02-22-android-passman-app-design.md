At the moment the android app is pretty default. 
We would love a material design but as coders we're bad designers.

We would love designed screens from the following things:
- Setup app (enter the nextcloud server settings)
- Display vault list
- Login to vault
- Display credential list
- Display a single credential (nicely formatted)
- Search credentials
- Page to change settings
- A "PIN" screen to unlock the app
- Edit credential
  - Bear in mind  that passman allows users to add custom fields (text / password /file)
  - Passman allows users to save their one time password token for generation
  - Should include a password generator
