A universal predictive model .Example people build apps and web apps based on a particular disease.People have to download different apps for different diseases. How about we combine them into one which will predict any type of disease from skin to uploading MRI AND DETECTING TUMOUR.Also this application could be used to predict the possible happening of any disease in the future depending on the persons current health status, habits etc and would also possibly show them possible path to avoid them example predicting a proper diet chart ,what type of excercise he/she should do.My point is this will be the universal of all the health applications.
First of all you need to have a huge amount of data for every disease which we can easily get.The problem arrives in the model .Creating a model such that it takes and predicts accurately with higher percentages.
This is a research based project.
