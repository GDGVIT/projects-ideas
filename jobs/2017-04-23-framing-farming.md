We can build an app for farmers in which they have to login with the state they live , the crop they grow , and the problems they often face . The app will be linked to the experts of that field that will suggest them online whenever they face any problem . This app will also help them to ask for any financial aid from government . But in country like India , farmers are not having android phones , so in one village a computer can be installed at any shop at which once in a week farmers can gather and discuss on crop matter and see the status of the rates of crops across the country by using this app so that they can't get fooled by the "bigger" people of by paying them less money.
