When you go to a mall to buy vegetables or fruits the charge you for it to the exact milligram. But the poor vegetable vendors always have to give out more more than the said quantity i.e. If you want to buy 500g of potatoes,  you will keep adding potatoes till it just more than the 500g. They lose around 200 Rs per day because of this. 
We can make an app which will have the list of vegetables they have and their cost price which can be changed every day. Then, for every customer, they can insert the exact weight of vegetables bought. And get the total bill. 
In theory the app sounds like a very simple idea and it is, but it would be such a great help to them. 
Later extra features can be added, like, the vendors can choose their own language.
