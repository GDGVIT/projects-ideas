We can make an inbuilt function.  The idea is just press one particular key for the long time, like for 3-5 seconds. Then from that we can track that number immediately and send the police or women safety team which one is nearby over there.  It just like no one other than that girl will know the what's going on. Every girl always bring her mobile phone while going out. So from this we can increase women safety.
