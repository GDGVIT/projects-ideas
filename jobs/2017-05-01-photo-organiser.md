We often come across issues of organising pics of a particiluar event,notes,trips etc.We used to organise them manually which consumes too much time and sometime duplicate pics also there.
This project involves creation of Albums before taking the photos of that event.
Suppose you are in a B'day party.Before taking the pics directly by your camera you can launch this app,which prompts you to create album for that B'day and then it launches camera app from where you can take your snaps.
A widget is immediately created whenever a new album is created so that user may not go thpught he creation process again and directly add more pics into that album by clicking that widget.


This project covers whatever I have learnt since my 5-month journey of Android-Learning.I wish to take AR apps & 2D game programing apps in future.
