Labsquare is a community of bioinformatics scientist whose aims to create opensource genomics tools. It is a great necessity with the arrival of new technologies of DNA highoutput sequencing. 

We released our first application named FastQt . It's a Qt/C++ based application which process DNA sequence file and generate several plot and statistics. 
You can have the application preview as a gif animation here :
