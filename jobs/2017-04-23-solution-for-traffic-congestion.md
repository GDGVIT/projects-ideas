On every road, IR sensors will be placed at suitable distances to calculate the density of traffic on the particular road. All sensors on the road will send signals to a mini server which will calculate the density of vehicles present on that road. The inputs from the mini servers of each road will be computed and compared by the main server of the area. An app will obtain information from the main server via a socket to give the fastest route to a destination. The app can be improved using artificial intelligence which will gather information about traffic patterns at different times of the day and different days of the week.
NOTE: IR sensors are used since they are economically viable and efficient for this purpose.
