We can design a app name "MY DAY" in which one can plan our whole day route. In this app one can enter all the work they have to do like the places they have to go the items they have to buy a particular day and how they can reach their destination on time.Like a working women want to reach her office at 9 and before that she had to drop her child to the office , collect some items for office and reach to office and then return back  from office at 1:30 And reach her home at 2:00 So that she can have lunch with her child and then return back to her office till 2:45 and again leave the office at 6:30 and meet her friend at ccd at 7 spend time with her and return back to home at 8:30. For that purpose she can use an this aap My day in which she can enter all the places she has to go and she can enter the items she has to purchase and with the help of this app she can find the best route sutaible for her in which can do most of the work at a time and managing all the time she has and using this app one can keep  a record of traffic level at different time . And using my day one will manage the least cost of travelling also . We will link Google map for this app to make our work easier.
