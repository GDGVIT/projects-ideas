The idea is to finish [flatui icons theme](https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-assets/issues/17) for xmb menu theme which will be available in [RetroArch](http://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-2) and [Lakka](http://www.lakka.tv) distribution.

RetroArch is the official reference frontend for the libretro API.

Lakka is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a small computer into a full blown game console.
