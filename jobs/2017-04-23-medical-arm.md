A device which makes medicine consumption easy for bedridden patients. It is an easy to use device which reminds the patient to take their medicines on time.
Medicine boxes are attached to a movable mechanism that is controlled using a joystick. Piezoelectric sensors are placed under the box which help measure the number of medicines. A buzzer is used to remind patients to take their medicine on time. An LED glows telling the patient about which medicine has to be taken. Data about the medicine consumption at various time intervals entered before hand. This device also sends an email and SMS alert when the medicine stock is less using raspberry pi. Data is uploaded on the cloud using IoT for future reference which can be accessed by doctors and other concerned people.
