Using the weather data of the last 50 years, we can devise an algorithm to suggest farmers the crops they should grow based on their geo-location, soil type and few other factors. This service will also show stats of how much percentage of people are growing a particular crop in that region preventing extra production of the same crop. Data from IOT devices can be used to further improve the results.
