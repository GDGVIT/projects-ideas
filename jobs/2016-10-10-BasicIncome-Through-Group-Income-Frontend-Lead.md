### Lead Frontend Developer

Want to work on basic income with us?

This is an opportunity to:

- Make basic income a reality for potentially millions of people.
- Impact how the world's economy works and the way groups and communities interact.
- Use the latest technologies in decentralized application design.

You'll work with a team of experts to finish [the prototype](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple) of [Group Income](/other/Group_Income.pdf) that will be used by real groups during our trial phrase.

#### Requirements

- You're a "designer" in the Apple sense. While you might not know much Photoshop, you do know how to make solid, user-friendly, secure applications.
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS expert.
- Expert in at least 1 other programming language.
- Fully grok git, and have made meaningful contributions to open source projects (your own or others).
- Fully grok [decentralization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8), or are excited to learn.
- Strong understanding of frontend security concepts. You know what to do. You know what not to do. And you certainly know the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
- Able to competently use GPG and other secure communications tools.
- Autodidact.
- Fluent in English.
- Are reliable; you don't make commitments you won't keep.

##### Nice To Have

- Knowledge of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), the framework we're using.

#### Compensation

Negotiated hourly rate, based on experience.

#### Perk: Membership in the Group Income Developers Group

After receiving the position and making at least one successful pull request, you'll be granted membership in a Group Income Group (GIG) that's specially purposed for Group Income contributors and is sustained by voluntary contributions from other GIGs. Members retain membership for one year after their most recent contribution, unless [voted out](/2016/06/what-makes-a-good-voting-system/#groupincome) ("disowned") by the existing members. Any funds you receive from this group are entirely separate and unrelated to any compensation you receive for contract work.

This Lead Frontend Developer will be eligible for one of the **five lifetime** "founders seats" in the developer GIG. The lifetime seats will go to the top 5 contributors to Group Income once it reaches its 1.0 public debut (the major release that comes after the prototype).

We'll post additional details about this special developer GIG to our blog.

#### Directions

To apply, email `hi [at] okturtles.com` the following:

- Description of your technical background, why you are applying for this position, and why we should choose you.
- Links to the source code of at least two software projects that you're most proud of (at least one of which must be in JavaScript).
- In your own words, what the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption is.
    + Bonus: send an encrypted email. Fingerprint: `0xC32DE6664644751C9B80D9984B4D4371A884B988`

Finally, **we recommend** (but don't require) sending a DM to [@Group_Income](https://twitter.com/Group_Income) with the subject of your email to make sure it doesn't get lost due to spam filters.

### Volunteer

Most of the people who work on Group Income do so as volunteers. If you'd like to join our volunteer team, [get in touch with us](/community/). We're looking for designers, developers, and writers.

*Whether you're a contractor or volunteer, every regular contributor to the development of Group Income will be added to the developer GIG mentioned above.*
