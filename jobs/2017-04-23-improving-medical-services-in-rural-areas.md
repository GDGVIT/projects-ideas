Target of the solution -the villages that are located in isolated areas and there is a dearth of medical facilities. In such areas people have to move to nearby towns  to get the check up done. Sometimes these doctors who come to treat them come from cities for particular period of time. But the problem is when there is an epidemic spread around the village, there can be a chaos. To provide better medical services at this point of time, the hospital should know that such crisis might occur. They can predict the problem before hand with the help of analysis of earlier trends. That is with medical records of history, they can predict what are the problems that will be be mostly encountered and hence the arrangement of doctors can be made to help the people. In general also, the doctors can be sent accordingly. As in a little more In number.
