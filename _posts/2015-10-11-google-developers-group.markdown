Google Developer Group- VIT is an open community chapter where like minded students come together to discuss, plan and implement projects. The community has developed a wide range of projects including utility based android applications that help the students track their day-to-day activities at VIT. We have developed web-based applications to help students plan out their time tables. Social-welfare projects during times of crises have been developed to help the community and further bring about a change.

Apart from generic domain projects, prototypes of projects from domains such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have also been implemented. Research based projects, such as projects involving big data analytics have been incorporated in order to bring about innovation.
