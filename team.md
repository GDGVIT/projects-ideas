###### GDG VIT Vellore's team is one of the best team.
 Google Developers Groups is an initiative by Google to support developers who are interested in Google's developer technology. 
 We take many forms - from just a few people getting together to develop and test new products to large gatherings with demos and tech talks.
##### Ongoing/Completed projects
We have successfully completed a wide pool of projects and are always working towards building the next big thing.
You can contribute to any of our projects at [github](http://github.com/GDGVIT)


##### What We Do

At GDG VIT Vellore, we have set out goals considering the skills of our inner circle members to take care of projects assigned.
You can have a look at our Inner Circle members [here](https://github.com/orgs/GDGVIT/people)
