###### GDG VIT Vellore is a non-profit developers group to develop, learn and share.
 Google Developer Group- VIT is an open community chapter where like minded students come together to discuss, plan and implement projects. The community has developed a wide range of projects including utility based android applications that help the students track their day-to-day activities at VIT. We have developed web-based applications to help students plan out their time tables. Social-welfare projects during times of crises have been developed to help the community and further bring about a change

##### Ongoing/Completed projects
We have successfully completed a wide pool of projects and are always working towards building the next big thing.
You can contribute to any of our projects at [github](http://github.com/GDGVIT)


##### What We Do
Apart from generic domain projects, prototypes of projects from domains such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have also been implemented. Research based projects, such as projects involving big data analytics have been incorporated in order to bring about innovation.
In order to maintain an all rounded community, teams of students from GDG-VIT have participated in the Google Online Marketing Challenge every year. A blog is maintained to keep students updated regarding the latest innovations in technology and events conducted by the chapter.
